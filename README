Hi!

 Thanks for the time you are going to spend grading my code! Looking forward to your comments!

compile:
g++ -std=c++11 prim.cpp

files:
prim.cpp ... main
graphs.cpp ... classes
test_graph.txt ... txt-file from the "my submission" tab
test_graph2.txt ... graph used by Ira Pohl to explain Dijkstra's alg. in lecture 2.5
